# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This file tracks major architectural decisions made during the project lifecycle. Each decision is documented using the ADR format to provide context, rationale, and trade-offs for future reference.

## How to Use This File

When making a significant architectural decision:

1. Add a new ADR entry below using the template
2. Increment the ADR number sequentially
3. Include date, status, context, decision, consequences, and alternatives
4. Link to relevant PRPs, commits, or documentation
